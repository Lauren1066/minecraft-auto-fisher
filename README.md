# Minecraft Auto Fisher

This project is a recode of [Elias123tre's auto fisher](https://github.com/elias123tre/minecraft-auto-fisher/tree/main), which I found was no longer working.

## Changes from Original
- **Local Screenshot Usage:** Now uses a locally stored screenshot for detection instead of fetching the image repeatedly from the internet. 
- **Configurable Variables:** Added variables that users can easily configure to suit their specific needs.
- **Enhanced Code Comments:** Comments have been added throughout the code, making it easier to understand and modify.
- **Refactored Code Structure:** The structure of the code has been revamped.

## Prerequisites
Before you start using the Auto Fisher, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. This script was developed and tested with Python 3.11.6.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - Download the code from this repository and extract it.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Open a command terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
   - Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary Python libraries.

4. **Script Configuration:**
   - Modify the configurable variables in the script as per your requirement.

5. **Running the Script:**
   - In the game, enable subtitles.
   - Run the script by executing `python fishing.py` in the command terminal.
   - Start fishing!
     
**Ensure that the game window is visible on the screen and not minimized.**

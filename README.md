**Minecraft Auto Fisher**

A recode of [Elias123tre's auto fisher](https://github.com/elias123tre/minecraft-auto-fisher/tree/main)

The above was no longer working for me. This is my recode.

Changes:
- Uses a screenshot stored locally instead of fetching the image each time.
- Added configurable variables
- Added comments so each part of the code is clear in it's intents
- Changed code structure
